% Part 1
% Consider 16QAM with a raised cosine pulse shape with ùõº = 0.5. 
% You should truncate the pulse so that p(t) = 0 for |t| > 4T. 
% Now take the following text, 
% "I am doing the computer exercises 5 for ece316 ‚Äì Fall 2020." 
% Translate the above text into a binary sequence using the ASCII code. 
% Include all the characters including spaces except the quotes. After you translate into a 
% binary sequence use a serial to parallel converter to produce two streams. Even bits go 
% to the In-phase channel (cos), and odd bits go to the quadrature channel (sin). 
% Then produce a 16QAM signal using the above pulse shape. Use a sampling period 
% equal to T/64 to submit an array with the signal. The carrier frequency of the signal 
% should be fc = 8/T. 
% Submit your code along with a file containing an array with the QAM signal.

% formula for the pulse below:
pulse = (sin(pi*t).*cos(a*pi*t)) ./ ((pi*t).*(1-(2*a*t).^2));

% Part 2
% Take the above QAM signal and demodulate it using a QAM demodulator. Draw the block 
% diagram for the QAM demodulator. First Use a local oscillator signal that is synchronized 
% with the carrier of the received signal. Then use a local Oscillator that has a phase error 
% equal ùúã/8, i.e. the local oscillator is cos(2ùúãùëì_ct + ùúã/8)

% Note that you should implement the 
% low pass filters using convolution in the time domain with the appropriate impulse 
% response, e.g. some sinc() pulse. After demodulating the signals plot them on the plane. 
% Then perform a transformation on the output signals in order to compensate for the effect 
% of carrier phase error. 

% Demodulating using a synchronized oscillator
%channel1 = pulse_sample.*cos(16*pi*(0:1/64:125));
%channel2 = pulse_sample.*sin(16*pi*(0:1/64:125));

% Demodulating with an oscillator with a phase error
channel1 = modulated_signal.*cos(16*pi*(0:1/64:125) + pi/8);
channel2 = modulated_signal.*sin(16*pi*(0:1/64:125) + pi/8);

% Low pass filter
N = num_samples; % Number of samples in the signal

fft_1 = fft(channel1);
fft_2 = fft(channel2);

filter(1:N) = 1;
Nb = floor(((1+a)*N)/128);
filter(Nb+2:N-Nb) = 0; % Set the middle area to be 0 to extract the baseband signal

% Channel outputs with phase errors
channel1out = ifft(filter.*fft_1);
channel2out = ifft(filter.*fft_2);
